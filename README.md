# SasView Pr SVD Jupyter Notebook
This is a short script to test out and incorporate SVD into the Inversion prospective for SasView. The main goal of this is to automate some of the (currently) Manual parameter setting. The code for this was written by @PBenderLux on his [Data-analysis](https://github.com/PBenderLux/Data-analysis) repository and minor changes have been made to allow it to work with SasView.
